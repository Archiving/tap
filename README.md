# Tapp

At UBC Local Hack Day,
This NFC reader for organizers to efficiently obtain accessibility information from event participants was built in ~9 hours.
The app consists of a user side app, named app2 in the repository and an organizer side app, named app in the repository.

Use is simple - on the user side, fill out the form containing all accessibility needs/dietary restrictions/personal information.
Click the save button to save this information as a file onto your phone, then simply tap the phone onto another phone with the organizer
app installed. This will transfer the form information to the organizer's phone.

On the organizer side, click view database to see all user data that has accumulated from taps, and use this information to make your event
more accessible and efficient for everyone!
